	abstract = {Molecular dynamics has been used for decades to generate data from which thermodynamic properties as defined by statistical mechanics can be computed. Though very powerful, molecular dynamics contains at least two key inefficiencies: (1) It is common to compute all forces present in a system during every step forward in time, though many forces are slow to evolve and to repeatedly compute them only serves as vigorous CPU exercise. (2) Rare events such as the transition from one state in a free energy minimum to another state in another free energy minimum are as rare in simulations as they are in reality. Thus, simulations which are already inefficient due to (1) require long simulation times for interesting properties to be calculated accurately. In this dissertation, both of these issues are addressed with novel simulation algorithms and methods, and real systems such as liquid water, a small polypeptide in solvent, and a peptide antigen/cell surface protein complex in solvent are probed. It is shown that computation time for molecular dynamics can be decreased by over an order of magnitude with the SIN(R) molecular dynamics integrator, while preserving physical properties of the system of interest, and that the path-dAFED and path-UFED enhanced sampling algorithms can recover accurate free energy differences of states with minimal pre- and post-processing of data.},

In particular, this kinetic energy can be nonglobally Lipschitz, which raises issues for the stability of discretizations of the associated Langevin dynamics. We first prove the exponential convergence of the law of the continuous process to the Boltzmann{\textendash}Gibbs measure by a hypocoercive approach and characterize the asymptotic variance of empirical averages over trajectories. We next develop numerical schemes which are stable and of weak order two by considering splitting strategies where the discretizations of the fluctuation/dissipation are corrected by a Metropolis procedure. We use the newly developed schemes for two applications: optimizing the shape of the kinetic energy for the so-called adaptively restrained Langevin dynamics (which considers perturbations of standard quadratic kinetic energies vanishing around the origin) and reducing the metastability of some toy models using nonglobally Lipschitz kinetic energies.},

The algorithm introduces distance classes to schedule updates of non-bonding interactions and to avoid unnecessary computations of interactions between particles which are far apart. To minimize the error caused by the updating schedule, the Verlet integration scheme has been modified. The results of the method are compared to those of other approximation schemesas well as to results obtained by numerical integration without approximation. For simulation of a protein with 12 637 atoms our approximation scheme yields a reduction of computer time by a factor of seven. The approximation suggested can be implemented on sequential as well as on parallel computers. We describe an implementation on a (Transputer-based) MIMD machine with a systolic ring architecture.},

	abstract = {Considered are numerical integration schemes for nondissipative dynamical systems in which multiple time scales are present. It is assumed that one can do an explicit separation of the RHS {\textquotedblleft}forces{\textquotedblright} into fast forces and slow forces such that (i) the fast forces contain the high frequency part of the solution, (ii) the fast forces are conservative, and (iii) the reduced problem consisting only of the fast forces can be integrated much more cheaply than the full problem. The fast forces are allowed to have low frequency components. Particular applications for which the schemes are intended include N-body problems (for which most of the forces are slow) and nonlinear wave phenomena (for which the fast forces can be propagated by spectral methods). The assumption of cheap integration of fast forces implies that the overall cost of integration is primarily determined by the step size used to sample the slow forces. A long-time-step method is one in which this step size exceeds half the period of the fastest normal mode present in the full system. An existing method that comes close to qualifying is the {\textquotedblleft}impulse{\textquotedblright} method, also known as Verlet-I and r-RESPA. It is shown that it might fail, though, for a couple of reasons. First, it suffers a serious loss of accuracy if the step size is near a multiple of the period of a normal mode, and, second, it is unstable if the step size is near a multiple of half the period of a normal mode. Proposed in this paper is a {\textquotedblleft}mollified{\textquotedblright} impulse method having an error bound that is independent of the frequency of the fast forces. It is also shown to possess superior stability properties. Theoretical results are supplemented by numerical experiments. The method is efficient and reasonably easy to implement.},

	abstract = {We present a revision to the well known Stormer-Verlet algorithm for simulating second order differential equations. The revision addresses the inclusion of linear friction with associated stochastic noise, and we analytically demonstrate that the new algorithm correctly reproduces diffusive behavior of a particle in a flat potential. For a harmonic oscillator, our algorithm provides the exact Boltzmann distribution for any value of damping, frequency, and time step for both underdamped and over damped behavior within the usual the stability limit of the Verlet algorithm. Given the structure and simplicity of the method we conclude this approach can trivially be adapted for contemporary applications, including molecular dynamics with extensions such as molecular constraints.},

	title = {Comparison of {Modern} {Langevin} {Integrators} for {Simulations} of {Coarse}-{Grained} {Polymer} {Melts}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00532},
	abstract = {For a wide range of phenomena, current computational ability does not always allow for fully atomistic simulations of high-dimensional molecular systems to reach time scales of interest. Coarse-graining (CG) is an established approach to alleviate the impact of computational limits while retaining the same algorithms used in atomistic simulations. It is of importance to understand how algorithms such as Langevin integrators perform on nontrivial CG molecular systems, and in particular how large of an integration time step can be used without introducing unacceptable amounts of error into averaged quantities of interest. To investigate this, we examined three different Langevin integrators on a CG polymer melt: the recently developed BAOAB method by Leimkuhler and Matthews [17], the Gr{\o}nbechJensen and Farago method [12], or G{\textendash}JF, and the frequently used Bru{\textasciidieresis}nger-Brooks-Karplus integrator [6], also known as BBK. We compute and analyze key statistical properties for each. Our results indicate that the three integrators perform similarly when using a small friction parameter; however, outside of this regime the use of large integration steps produces significant deviations from the predicted diffusivity and steady-state distributions for all integration methods examined with the exception of G{\textendash}JF.},

	abstract = {We expand on the previously published Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen Farago (GJF) thermostat, which is a thermodynamically sound variation on the St{\o}rmer-Verlet algorithm for simulating discrete-time Langevin equations. The GJF method has been demonstrated to give robust and accurate configurational sampling of the phase space, and its applications to, e.g. Molecular Dynamics is well established. A new definition of the discrete-time velocity variable is proposed based on analytical calculations of the kinetic response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to friction and noise. The new companion velocity to the GJF method is demonstrated to yield exact and time-step-independent kinetic responses for, e.g. kinetic energy, its fluctuations, and Green-Kubo diffusion based on velocity autocorrelations. This observation allows for a new and convenient Leap-Frog algorithm, which efficiently and exactly represents statistical measures of both kinetic and configurational properties at any time step within the stability limit for systems in linear and harmonic potentials. We outline the simplicity of the algorithm and demonstrate its attractive time-step-independent features for nonlinear and complex systems through applications to a one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator and three-dimensional Molecular Dynamics.},

	abstract = {We reformulate the algorithm of Gr\{{\textbackslash}o\}nbech-Jensen and Farago (GJF) for Langevin dynamics simulations at constant temperature. The GJF algorithm has become increasingly popular in molecular dynamics simulations because it provides robust (i.e., insensitive to variations in the time step) and accurate configurational sampling of the phase space with larger time steps than other Langevin thermostats. In the original derivation [Mol. Phys. \{{\textbackslash}bf 111\}, 983 (2013)], the algorithm was formulated as a velocity-Verlet type integrator with an in-site velocity variable. Here, we reformulate it as a leap frog scheme with a half-step velocity variable. In contrast to the original form, the reforumlated one also provides robust and accurate estimations of kinetic measures such as the average kinetic energy. We analytically prove that the newly presented algorithm gives the exact configurational and kinetic temperatures of a harmonic oscillator for any time step smaller than the Verlet stability limit, and use computer simulations to demonstrate the configurational and kinetic robustness of the algorithm in strongly non-linear systems. This property of the new formulation of the GJF thermostat makes it very attractive for implementation in computer simulations.},
